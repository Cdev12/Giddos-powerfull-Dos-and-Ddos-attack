**Open Source Software Installation and Requirements Guide**

Introduction
This software is open source, meaning anyone can download, modify, and enhance it according to their needs. However, it is essential to follow the correct installation steps to ensure optimal functionality and to prevent potential issues during setup.

Before you begin the installation of GiDDOS-HackSoftware 3.0, you must first install the necessary Python dependencies and ensure that the required JavaScript files are in place. Failing to do so can result in installation errors. If any required files are missing, you will need to remove certain components and restart the installation process. It is strongly recommended to ensure all components are downloaded and set up correctly before running the setup for a seamless experience.

Please note that this program is resource-intensive, utilizing both Python and JavaScript to flood web servers or public IP connections.

**Prerequisites**
Before running GiDDOS-HackSoftware 3.0, ensure that the required dependencies and files are installed. These steps must be followed in the exact order to avoid installation conflicts.

Python Requirements: The program depends on several Python libraries to handle HTTP requests and various networking functionalities. Make sure Python is installed and the necessary modules are correctly configured.

JavaScript Files: Two sets of JavaScript files are located in the /js folder. These files need to be installed and properly configured. If they are missing or placed in the wrong directory, the installation will not proceed successfully. These JavaScript files are applied automatically during the installation process of GiDDOS-HackSoftware 3.0, ensuring that all required functionalities are set up without any manual intervention.

**Installation Order**
To avoid installation errors and ensure everything functions properly, follow the steps below in the exact order:

Install Python Requirements (requirements)
This step is essential for setting up the Python environment with the necessary packages for the software to function correctly. If these dependencies are not installed, the program may not work as expected.

**Installation Steps:**

Download and install Python from python.org/downloads, if you don't have it installed already.

Open the terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Install JavaScript Functional Files (jsFunctionalities)
These JavaScript files are crucial for the proper execution of the program, as they handle requests and network connections.

**Installation Steps:**

Download the JavaScript files associated with the project.

Place the files in the same directory as the GiDDOS-HackSoftware 3.0 executable.

Ensure the files are named correctly and placed in the appropriate location, so the setup can recognize them.

Note: These JavaScript files will be automatically applied during the installation process of the software, so there is no need for manual configuration during setup.

Install JavaScript Requirements (jsRequirements)
Additional JavaScript dependencies must be installed to ensure the software works correctly. These modules manage necessary HTTP connections and request handling during the software’s operation.

**Installation Steps:**

Download the required JavaScript files.

Ensure you have the proper Node.js dependencies and other necessary files.

Execute the JavaScript files that configure the network environment and functionality.

**Installation Procedure**
Run the Setup
After you’ve installed and configured the Python and JavaScript files, proceed to run the GiDDOS-HackSoftware 3.0 setup. This will initiate the installation process.

**Installation Process**
During the installation, the software will download necessary components, configure your system, and automatically apply the required JavaScript files. If everything is set up correctly, this process should be quick and straightforward. Once the required files and dependencies are in place, the installation will complete successfully.

**Hardware Considerations**
Keep in mind that this software is quite demanding in terms of system resources. It uses both Python and JavaScript to conduct attacks on web servers or public IP addresses. Ensure your system meets the hardware requirements to avoid performance degradation or crashes during execution.

**Troubleshooting**
If you encounter issues during installation or while using the software:

Verify that all Python and JavaScript files are installed correctly.

Ensure that all necessary files are placed in the proper directory.

If you experience dependency issues, repeat the Python requirements installation process.

If there are errors during the installation of setup.exe, uninstall any previous installations and restart the process from scratch.

**Conclusion**
By following these instructions in the correct order, you can ensure a smooth and successful installation of GiDDOS-HackSoftware 3.0. Properly installing and configuring both the Python and JavaScript dependencies is crucial for the software to function properly. If everything is set up correctly, the installation will be quick and seamless, enabling you to use the software effectively.

**Warning!**
This program is intended for pentesting purposes only. It should only be used with explicit permission from the owner of the system being tested. Unauthorized use of this software may be illegal and could result in legal consequences. Use at your own risk.
